                About Sand o' Plenty
            </header>
            <div class="text">
                Sand o' Plenty is shader-based game inspired
                after the popular <a href="#cellular_automata">cellular automata </a> genre of games.
                I was heavily to inpsired to try coding such a game after watching
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868">The Code Train's vide</a> on the same topic.
                I was up for the challenge and wanted to create a
                sand game of my own. IIt didn't take long until
                an afternoon coding session turned into a full-on
                coding journey. I was determined to create a
                high-performance physics particle simulator where
                every pixel on the screen would act as a sand particle.
                <br>
                I wanted to document the journey along the way and create
                a comprehensive guide on creating a falling sand simulation
                yourself. The code of the game is also publicly avalibale 
                on my <a href="">GitHub</a> page. I am more than happy for others
                to contribute to this project. More details on how you can do
                so is also on the GitHub page.

                Cellular automata
            </header>

                I'm sure most of you have heard of cellular automata. However, if not,
                one can call cellular automata as an arrangement of cells in a grid-like
                structure in which each cell is in a certain state and can switch
                between some other states based on some rules regarding the surounding cells' states.
                Cellular automata display a system in which complexity arises from very simple
                behavior. Becuse of this, they are usually subject of mathematical
                studies. They can be used to simulate various dynamic systems and 
                algorithms. However, it is not a rare thing for cellular automata to be 
                used in more artistic or gamedev circles. You probably have heard of
                , a popular Steam release game that utilises 
                the concept of cellular automata in a way where every pixel of the game
                is affected by physics. Alongside Noita, you probably have also heard
                of <a href="">Conway's game of life</a> created by the British mathematician
                John Horton Conway.
